## Where we are

**v8 ready to train. Three major optimizations landed. BIOS training 2.7x faster.**

DualMERA (559M, 99.7% ternary, d=1024) with Qwen3 BBPE tokenizer.
Training loop uses **evolutionary mutation** (not gradient-based flips)
and **MLX quantized_matmul** (not custom Metal kernels). Computation
probe detects grokking by testing generalization on novel inputs.

## What to do next

### 1. ~~Smoke-test v8 BIOS training~~ ✅ DONE (session 051)

Model init, data loading, forward/backward all verified clean.

### 2. ~~Evolutionary topology mutation~~ ✅ DONE (session 051)

Replaced gradient-based flip accumulation with mutation + tournament:
- `mutation_cone(r_ema)` → quadratic budget from relational loss
- `save/load_topology()` → champion double-buffer (never degrades)
- `mutate_topology()` → packed in-place mutation (0.037s for 559K mutations)
- `run_tournament()` → 4 strategies (conservative/standard/aggressive/explorer)
- Eliminated grad_w dense matmul (442M float32 elements per backward pass)

### 3. ~~MLX quantized_matmul~~ ✅ DONE (session 051)

Replaced custom Metal ternary kernels with `mx.quantized_matmul(bits=2)`:
- Custom Metal shaders → Apple AMX hardware path
- 2.3-3.7x faster per matmul, 1.7x end-to-end
- No custom VJP needed — MLX autograd handles everything natively
- `stop_gradient(weight)` prevents invalid grad through uint32
- TernaryEmbedding unchanged (gather, not matmul)

### 4. ~~Computation probe~~ ✅ DONE (session 051)

`scripts/v8/compute_probe.py` — grokking detector:
- Generates fresh examples (never in training data) at 3 tiers
- Greedy-decodes model output, checks exact match vs ground truth
- Integrated into train.py at eval_interval
- Accuracy 0% → >0% = circuit formation signal

### 5. Train v8 BIOS flash ← NEXT

```bash
uv run python scripts/v8/train.py --phase bios
```

- 559M all-ternary DualMERA on 1 shard (49.75M tokens, ~16 epochs)
- 50K steps at ~9.5k tok/s ≈ 25.5 hours
- Monitor for grokking: loss plateau → second drop + probe accuracy >0%
- Evolution: cone narrows as r_ema → 0, topology crystallizes
- Checkpoints every 5K steps, eval+probe every 1K steps

### 6. Train v8 Dolma (after BIOS)

```bash
uv run python scripts/v8/train.py --phase dolma --resume checkpoints/v8-bios/step_050000
```

- Resume from BIOS checkpoint, narrow cone (protect BIOS circuits)
- 60 shards, 3B tokens, seq_len=4096
- Deep circuits should resist overwriting by prose

### 7. Future: io! notation + sieve pipeline

- Update `bb clj2lambda` for `io!` with `:as` annotations
- Pure/effectful classification training
- Multi-pass examples (partial reductions, register usage)

## Session 051 — Evolutionary Training + Quantized Kernels

### What was done

1. **Smoke-tested BIOS training** — 559M params, 512 seq_len, data loading,
   forward/backward all clean. Initial throughput: 3.3k tok/s.

2. **Profiled the performance bottleneck** — backward pass was 73% of step
   time, dominated by `grad_w = gs_2d.T @ x_2d` (442M float32 gradients).
   This dense matmul existed only for sign-based flip accumulation — the
   optimizer never used it.

3. **Replaced gradient flips with evolutionary mutation** — ternary topology
   is now a genome that evolves via mutation + tournament selection.
   Relational loss forms a cone-shaped restriction: wide at r≈1 (explore),
   narrow at r≈0 (frozen). Champion never degrades (double-buffered).
   Result: 3.3k → 5.9k tok/s.

4. **Profiled ternary kernel performance** — custom Metal kernels were
   2-4x SLOWER than float32 matmul. Root cause: 1024× memory access
   amplification (1M threads each independently reading same rows) +
   GPU shader cores vs AMX hardware. The bit-shift decode was negligible
   (0.24ms for full model).

5. **Replaced Metal kernels with MLX quantized_matmul** — 2-bit affine
   quantization maps ternary {-1,0,+1} cleanly to MLX's uint32 format.
   Apple's optimized AMX path: 2.3-3.7x per matmul. MLX autograd handles
   backward natively — no custom VJP needed. Result: 5.9k → 9.5k tok/s.

6. **Built computation probe** — generates fresh math/clojure examples,
   greedy-decodes, checks exact match. Three tiers. Integrated into
   train.py at eval intervals. Grokking signal: accuracy 0% → >0%.

### Performance journey

| Change | tok/s | BIOS 50K | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| Start (gradient flips + custom Metal) | 3.3k | 69h | 1.0x |
| + Evolutionary mutation (no grad_w) | 5.9k | 41h | 1.7x |
| + MLX quantized_matmul (AMX path) | 9.5k | 25.5h | 2.7x |

### Design decisions made

- **Gradient descent for continuous, evolution for discrete** — clean
  separation. Adam trains gamma and norms. Tournament selects topology.
  No gradient through ternary weights at all.
- **Relational loss IS the temperature** — no separate annealing schedule.
  The cone narrows naturally as the model learns.
- **MLX quantized_matmul over custom kernels** — Apple's AMX hardware
  path beats any custom Metal shader. The ternary concept is sound;
  the implementation needed Apple's infrastructure.
- **Computation probe over loss-only monitoring** — loss can drop via
  memorization. The probe tests actual generalization on novel inputs.
  Accuracy >0% is the definitive circuit formation signal.

### Architecture insight: why ternary was slow

The custom Metal ternary kernel was naive: 1 thread per output element,
no tiling, no shared memory. For a 1024×1024 matmul:
- 1M threads each read 4KB independently = 4.6 GB total traffic
- But unique data is only 4.5 MB
- **1024× memory amplification**

Plus: custom Metal shaders run on GPU compute units. Apple's matmul
(including quantized_matmul) dispatches to AMX — dedicated matrix
hardware that custom shaders cannot access.

The bit-shift decode was ~0.24ms — essentially free. The ternary
concept works. It just needs Apple's optimized paths.

## Session 050 — Data Pipeline + Training Loop

### What was done

1. **Dolma re-tokenization** — GPT-NeoX (50277) → Qwen3 BBPE (151936)
   - `scripts/v8/retokenize_dolma.py`: streams parquets, 931K tok/s
   - 60 shards × 50M tokens = 3B tokens, 4.47M documents, zero errors
   - Output: `/Users/mwhitford/data/fractal-bitnet/shards-qwen3/`

2. **BIOS flash data generator** — babashka eval-verified
   - `bb/us/whitford/verbum/bios.clj`: ~80 generators, 3 notations
   - Math tiers 1-3 (arithmetic, compound, nested) + clojure.core (~110 functions)
   - Single notation per example — forces computation every time
   - 1.85M examples → 49.75M tokens → 1 shard
   - Pipeline: `bb gen-bios | uv run python scripts/v8/pack_bios.py`

3. **v8 training loop** — DualMERA with phase modes
   - `scripts/v8/train.py`: `--phase bios` (burn-in) or `--phase dolma` (prose)
   - BIOS: 1 shard, seq=512, aggressive ternary flips, many epochs
   - Dolma: 60 shards, seq=4096, conservative flips, resumes from BIOS
   - Cosine LR, grad accumulation, ternary flip annealing, relational loss

### Design decisions made

- **Single-notation examples** for BIOS flash — model must compute every
  result from the expression alone. No multi-representation interleaving.
- **Babashka IS ground truth** — all generation from babashka eval.
- **Phase flag** over config-driven — `--phase bios|dolma` sets sensible
  defaults, individual flags override.
- **Simplified from v7** — no per-stage phase controllers.

## Session 049 — Architecture + All-Ternary + Tokenizer

### What was done

1. **Rewrote `scripts/v8/model.py` from scratch** — clean break from v7
   - CompressorMERA + PipelineMERA = DualMERA
   - d=1024, 6 effective levels at seq=512, 8 at seq=4096
   - 4 parallel pathways per sieve level, feedback cascade

2. **All-ternary conversion** — TernaryEmbedding + TernaryLinear everywhere
   - 559M logical params, 99.7% ternary, 146 MB packed storage

3. **Qwen3 BBPE tokenizer** — vocab 151,936, byte-level BPE, no UNK tokens

## v7 Dolma Run — Summary

Ran steps 0-40K (~655M tokens). Killed at 40K — eval peaked at
20K then monotonically worsened. Architecture validated but Dolma
can't train deep stages. Math stratum was the only one still growing.
Diagnosis: architecture right, data wrong. Full probe data in
results/vsm-lm-v7/.

## v8 Architecture — Dual MERA

**Full design doc:** `mementum/knowledge/explore/v7.1-sieve-pipeline.md`

```
COMPRESSOR MERA (~253M ternary, incl. 156M embedding):
  8 levels: level 0 own (stride 8) + levels 1-7 shared MERA (stride 2 each)
  W=8, seq_len=4096, d_model=1024, Qwen3 vocab=151936
  8 register positions pass through all levels
  Output: multi-scale representations + register states

PIPELINE MERA (~335M ternary):
  8 levels, each a sieve with 4 parallel pathways (2L ternary each)
  Level 0 own + levels 1-7 shared sieve weights
  7 reducers + 7 feedback cascade steps

TOTAL: 559M logical, ~146 MB packed, 99.7% ternary
```

### Training regime: evolutionary gradient descent

- Ternary topology = genome (559M loci × 3 alleles)
- Continuous params (gamma, norms) = Adam
- Double-buffered: champion never degrades
- 4 mutant strategies per generation (conservative/standard/aggressive/explorer)
- Mutation cone shaped by relational loss (r_ema)
- Forward/backward via MLX quantized_matmul (Apple AMX, 2-bit)
